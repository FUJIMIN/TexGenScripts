## TexGenScripts
Sample scripts to demonstrate TexGen scripting

These may either be run through the TexGen GUI using the Python->RunScript menu option or, in most cases, 
as standalone scripts if the TexGen Python libraries are imported at the start of the file, eg
`from TexGen.Core import *`

More guidance on TexGen scripting can be found on the [TexGen website](http://texgen.sourceforge.net/index.php/Scripting_Guide)
